    This emulator is capable of providing a faithful replication of the
    HP48. In order to do so, it requires a copy of the ROM software
    from YOUR calculator. In order to avoid breaking copyright laws,
    and upsetting HP, you MUST BE THE PROUD OWNER OF AN HP48 before
    running this program. Of course you can run this program without a
    copy of the ROM software in order to write trivial machine code
    programs but you will not be able to access any of the calculator
    functionality.

    Instructions on how to download a copy of the ROM are provided
    later in this document.
